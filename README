# WTF IS DFORMD?

Dformd is an open source project, the brain child of Matt Quackenbush and Matt Graf.
Its name is derived from the intended goal of demystifying form use within software
projects. How?

	1. Separating form design and form code.
	2. Allow designers to do their job and change the form look however they want
		without involving a developer.
	3. Allow developers to do their job and not care about implementation/design.

## OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE FTW!

As an open source project Dformd is intended to be used on open source platforms/engines.
Will it work on a closed source platform/engine? Quite possibly, but it is not tested
on them.

> I really need it to work on {closed source platform}. Can you guys support that, please?

No, we won't test/certify it on any closed source platform unless you're paying HUGE money,
in cash.

> How much cash will it take?

A lot more than you are willing to part with, we're sure. If you're that desperate and have
a ridiculous amount of cash to waste, contact us (see below) with your offer and we'll see
if it piques our interest at the time. (Be sure to include the cash value of your offer as
well as any other pertinent information such as platform, deadline (if any), etc.)

> Why are you so adamant about open source software?

Simply put, open source software is what makes the world go around. It is the only way to
level the playing field and provides opportunity for EVERYONE. We didn't create this project
for financial gain. We created it because we thought it'd be a great way to support people
and have some fun doing so.

## CONTRIBUTIONS / OTHER LANGUAGE PORTS / CONTACT

We have planned ports of Dformd to other languages, but this first release is CFML.
